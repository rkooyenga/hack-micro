# 🚀 HackMicro

**A lightning-fast, zero-install web IDE for building, remixing, and slurping the web — straight from your browser.**

> 🧠 *"It's like CodePen, if CodePen booted in 100ms, ran locally, didn't phone home, let you create-edit-import-export without login, and let you hijack other websites while sipping coffee."*

### 🛠️ What It Is

HackMicro is a **browser-based micro IDE** that:

* Runs as a **bookmarklet** (no install required — like, really none)
* Imports, executes, and exports HTML/JS/CSS without touching the `<head>`
* Has a built-in **scraper proxy**: type any URL and see it rendered locally
* Lets you tweak and re-save the result as a portable HTML one-pager

Think: DevTools console meets mini VSCode meets a very polite MITM proxy.

### ✨ Killer Features

**🔍 “Slurp Mode” — Built-in scraper**
Paste any URL and HackMicro pulls down the HTML, rewrites it to run locally, and lets you modify or export it. Great for remixing, debugging, or archiving pages.

> *Why "View Source" when you can hijack the entire site in one click?*

**📦 All-in-one, one-page HTML exports**

* No setup required
* Injects your code into the page safely
* Strips duplicate `<head>` boilerplate on import/export
* Executable in other apps or frameworks — stays clean on round-trips

**🪶 Lightweight but smart**

* Toggle layout panels instantly with click/hold gestures
* Optional dropdown for title, base URL, and extra head tags
* Clean minimal UI — feels like writing on a napkin with autocomplete

**⚙️ Runs everywhere**

* ✅ Bookmarklet (Data URI, no install)
* 🧱 Soon: Web App, PWA, Chrome Extension
* ⏱️ Loads fast

### 🧠 Why It Matters

There’s no shortage of “code playgrounds” and “web IDEs.”
But HackMicro is:

* **Local-first**: runs in your browser, not some server cluster
* **Ephemeral-friendly**: don’t want to sign up or create a project? You’re already coding.
* **Scraper-native**: built with data liberation in mind, not lockdowns
* **Exportable**: everything you write becomes a standalone file you can ship, paste, reuse

It’s a tool for developers, tinkerers, and creators who want speed and control — not dashboards and lock-in.

### 📍 Status

Currently in **prototype** — usable, fast, fun.
Roadmap includes:

* ✅ JS version (done)
* ✅ Bookmarklet
* 🧪 Scraper proxy support
* 🧠 Header-aware imports/exports
* 🕹️ Web App + PWA
* 🧩 Chrome Extension

### 🧪 Try It Now

> Drag this to your bookmarks bar: **\[HackMicro]\(javascript:/* bookmarklet here */)**
> (Real link soon — GitHub doesn't allow direct bookmarklets inline.)

Or run the script from console in any page to inject the editor.

---

### 💡 Use Cases

* Paste HTML/JS/CSS snippets and test without a full IDE
* Rewrite, remix, or fork real websites — instantly
* Save interactive one-pager tools, slideshows, resumes, or demos
* Share fully self-contained experiments as .html files

* The raw utility of [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net), [CodePen](https://codepen.io), and [Glitch](https://glitch.com)
* The freedom of [DataHoarders](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/)
* The calm UX of old-school Mac apps and Linux TTY editors
* The modern need for tools that get out of your way and just let you build
