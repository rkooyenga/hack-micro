> 🧠 *"It's like CodePen, if CodePen booted in 100ms, ran locally, didn't phone home, let you create-edit-import-export without login, and let you slurp up websites for breakfast."*

### 🛠️ What It Is

HackMicro is a extremely lightweight and simple **browser-based micro IDE** that:

* Runs as a **bookmarklet** (no install required — like, really none)
* Imports, executes, simple web apps
* Has a built-in **scraper**: type a URL and see it rendered locally
* Lets you tweak and re-save the result as a portable HTML one-pager

---

### ✨ Killer Features

**🔍 “Slurp Mode” — Built-in scraper**
Provide a URL and HackMicro will attempt to scrape it without you having to view source the other site and one by one copy the contents of or the file refernces of all resources. It pulls down the HTML, rewrites it to run locally, and lets you modify or export it. Great for remixing, debugging, or archiving pages. 

**📦 All-in-one, one-page HTML exports**

* No setup required
* Injects your code into the page safely
* Can add or strip some duplicate `<head>` boilerplate on import/export
* Executable in other apps or frameworks — stays clean on round-trips with one page exports

**🪶 Lightweight but smart**

* Codepanels size themselves in an intuitive fashion that feels natural
* Toggle layout pattern for coding, rendering or both is uniquely simple and intuitive with click/hold gestures
* Optional dropdown for title, base URL, and extra head tags
* Clean minimal UI laid out in a sensible natural way. Stripped down not overpacked, optimized for editing or creating smaller projects.

* pro tip did your ChatGPT just give you a page or css or js snippet you need to test or evaluate? Absolutely perfect use case for HackMicro

**⚙️ Runs everywhere**

* ✅ Bookmarklet (Data URI, no install)
* 🧱 Soon: Web App, PWA, Chrome Extension
* ⏱️ Loads light
* ⏱️ Loads fast
* ⏱️ Loads fast
* ⏱️ Did we say it's light and fast?

### 🧠 Why It Matters

There’s no shortage of “code playgrounds” and “web IDEs.”
But HackMicro is:

* **Local-first**: runs in your browser, not some server cluster
* **Ephemeral-friendly**: don’t want to sign up or create a project? You’re already coding.
* **Scraper-native**: built with data liberation in mind, not lockdowns
* **Exportable**: everything you write becomes a standalone file you can ship, paste, reuse

It’s a tool for developers, tinkerers, and creators who want speed and control — not dashboards and lock-in.
